    <p>Hi - I'm Andrew!</p>

    <p>
        I'm the creator of <a href="//sparkshell.dev">SparkShell</a> and <a
            href="//github.com/radeeyate">some other things I find cool</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        I got into coding and electronics when I was younger, and have since
        done things I never though I would be able to do. I can't say the amount
        of hours I've spent debugging, but it's given me some really cool
        opportunities in life. I've designed PCBs and made some other cool stuff
        on the way, but I have a lot more to come my way.
    </p>

    <p>
        My email is me@radi8.dev. Feel free to reach out!
    </p>

    <p>
        - Andrew
    </p>
